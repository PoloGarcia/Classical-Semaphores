Classical Semaphores
====================

The following files include a implementation of semaphores in ANSI C, I solve them in a Operative Systems lecture and uploaded them here hoping some one could find them useful.

Here is a simple list with a reference to wikipedia of each problem included in this repo: 

1.- **Cigarrette Smokers** : [Wiki Reference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette_smokers_problem) 

2.- **Dining philosophers** : [Wiki Reference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem)

3.- **No Starve Mutex** : [Wiki Reference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion)

4.- **Producer Consumer** : [Wiki Reference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem)

5.- **Reader Writer** : [Wiki Reference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers%E2%80%93writers_problem)

And finally here is the [Little book of semaphores](http://greenteapress.com/semaphores/downey08semaphores.pdf) which helped me to understand some doubts I had during the lecture, hope can do the same for you. 

Remember to use this with responsability.
